This project is a self-practice implementation of Decision Tree Regression for predicting the quality of red wines based on their physicochemical features. The dataset was taken from Kaggle (Red Wine Quality Dataset) and includes the following input features:



fixed acidity, volatile acidity, citric acid, residual sugar, chlorides, free sulfur dioxide, total sulfur dioxide, density, pH, sulphates, and alcohol.

The target variable is quality, which represents the overall wine quality score given by wine tasters.



In this project, a Decision Tree Regression model was trained to learn how these chemical properties influence the wineâ€™s quality score. The model captures non-linear relationships and provides interpretable, rule-based predictions, showing how each feature contributes to the final output. This exercise helped me understand how decision trees split data into meaningful rules, avoid the need for feature scaling, and control model complexity to prevent overfitting.
