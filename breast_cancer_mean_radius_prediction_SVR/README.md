# breast_cancer_mean_radius_prediction_SVR
This repository contains a self-practice machine learning project where I implemented a Support Vector Regression (SVR) model to predict the mean radius of breast cell nuclei (radius_mean) using a dataset obtained from Kaggle. The dataset includes various quantitative measurements that describe the physical and geometrical properties of breast tumor cells — such as texture, perimeter, area, smoothness, compactness, concavity, and symmetry. Each of these features represents an important morphological characteristic of the cells, extracted from digitized images of breast tissue samples.  The main objective of this project was to explore and understand how Support Vector Regression (SVR) with the Radial Basis Function (RBF) kernel can be used for predicting a continuous variable (radius_mean). I applied feature scaling (StandardScaler) to standardize both the feature matrix (X) and the target variable (y) before training the model. After training the SVR model on the training set (x_train, y_train), I made predictions on the test set and used inverse transformation to bring the predicted results back to their original scale. The predicted and actual values were then displayed side by side to evaluate the model’s performance.  This project was created as a learning exercise to practice real-world regression modeling using Scikit-learn, NumPy, and Pandas. It helped me understand how feature scaling, kernel selection, and data transformation play a vital role in improving model accuracy and interpretability. The results confirmed that SVR with the RBF kernel is a powerful approach for handling non-linear relationships in biomedical datasets.
