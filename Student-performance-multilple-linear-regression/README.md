Student Performance Prediction using Multiple Linear Regression

This project implements a Multiple Linear Regression model to predict a student's Performance Index based on several academic and lifestyle factors, including:

Hours Studied

Previous Scores

Extracurricular Activities

Sleep Hours

Number of Sample Question Papers Practiced

The model analyzes how these features collectively influence student performance and provides a data-driven way to estimate academic outcomes.
