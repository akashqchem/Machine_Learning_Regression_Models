Simple Linear Regression model to analyze drug potency (pIC50) vs percentage inhibition.



This simple project applies a simple linear regression model to study the relationship between drug potency (pIC50) and percentage inhibition.



&nbsp;1. Drug Potency (pIC50)



Tells you how much drug concentration is needed to get an effect.



Higher pIC50 → more potent → works at lower concentrations.



2\. Percentage Inhibition



Tells you how much the drug blocks the target protein at a given concentration.



Higher % inhibition → stronger blocking.



3\. Their relationship



If a drug is potent (high pIC50), it usually means:

Even at low concentrations, it achieves high % inhibition.



If a drug is weak (low pIC50), you need a higher concentration to see the same % inhibition.



In regression terms:

Is there a linear relationship between potency (pIC50) and percentage inhibition?



Positive correlation: As potency increases, inhibition also increases.



This validates that more potent drugs (effective at small doses) do indeed block more strongly.
