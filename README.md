Machine Learning Regression Models

This repository contains a collection of self-practice machine learning regression projects developed as part of my continuous learning journey in data science. Each project demonstrates a different regression technique and explores how various algorithms capture relationships between independent variables and continuous target values. The purpose of this repository is to strengthen my understanding of regression modeling concepts, implementation, and evaluation using real-world datasets.

Objectives:

1. Implement different types of regression algorithms and understand their core principles.



2. Study the effects of feature scaling, kernel selection, and model hyperparameters.



3. Compare regression model performance and visualize prediction accuracy across datasets.



Included Projects:

1. Simple Linear Regression: Predicting drug potency (pIC50) versus percentage inhibition.


2. Multiple Linear Regression: Predicting student performance index based on multiple academic factors.


3. Polynomial Regression: Predicting fish weight from multiple length and height measurements.


4. Support Vector Regression (SVR): Predicting the mean radius of breast cancer cell nuclei using morphological features.


5. Decision Tree Regression: predicting the quality of red wines based on their physicochemical features.


6. Random Forest Regression: Implemented using the QM9 dataset to predict the HOMO-LUMO energy gap for 5000 molecules.



Tools and Libraries: 

1. Python

2. Scikit-learn

3. NumPy

4. Pandas



Learning Outcome:

Through these regression projects, I aim to develop a deeper understanding of:

1. Regression theory and practical implementation.

2. Model training, evaluation, and inverse data transformation.

3. The importance of feature scaling and hyperparameter tuning.

4. Comparing simple, kernel-based, and ensemble regression models for predictive analysis.


All projects are implemented in Google Colab notebooks (.ipynb) using datasets sourced from publicly available platforms such as Kaggle, created purely for self-learning and experimentation.
