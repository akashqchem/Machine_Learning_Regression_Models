# Machine Learning Regression Models

# 

# This repository contains a collection of self-practice machine learning regression projects developed as part of my continuous learning journey in data science. Each project demonstrates a different regression technique and explores how various algorithms capture relationships between independent variables and continuous target values. The purpose of this repository is to strengthen my understanding of regression modeling concepts, implementation, and evaluation using real-world datasets.

# 

# Objectives

# 

# Implement different types of regression algorithms and understand their core principles.

# 

# Study the effects of feature scaling, kernel selection, and model hyperparameters.

# 

# Compare regression model performance and visualize prediction accuracy across datasets.

# 

# Included Projects

# 

# Simple Linear Regression: Predicting drug potency (pIC50) versus percentage inhibition.

# 

# Multiple Linear Regression: Predicting student performance index based on multiple academic factors.

# 

# Polynomial Regression: Predicting fish weight from multiple length and height measurements.

# 

# Support Vector Regression (SVR): Predicting the mean radius of breast cancer cell nuclei using morphological features.

# 

# Decision Tree Regression: (Upcoming) Modeling complex non-linear relationships through hierarchical feature splits.

# 

# Random Forest Regression: (Upcoming) Using ensemble methods for improved regression performance and prediction accuracy.

# 

# Tools and Libraries

# 

# Python

# 

# Scikit-learn

# 

# NumPy

# 

# Pandas

# 

# Matplotlib / Seaborn

# 

# Learning Outcome

# 

# Through these regression projects, I aim to develop a deeper understanding of:

# 

# Regression theory and practical implementation.

# 

# Model training, evaluation, and inverse data transformation.

# 

# The importance of feature scaling and hyperparameter tuning.

# 

# Comparing simple, kernel-based, and ensemble regression models for predictive analysis.

# 

# All projects are implemented in Jupyter Notebooks (.ipynb) using datasets sourced from publicly available platforms such as Kaggle for self-learning and experimentation.
